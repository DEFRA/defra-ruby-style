This repository is used to manage the ruby code style we use at DEFRA.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Gemfile`

```ruby
group :test, :development do
  gem "defra_ruby_style"
end
```

And then update your dependencies by calling

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

If your project hasn't got one, create the file `.rubocop.yml` in its root and add the following:

```ruby
inherit_gem:
  defra_ruby_style:
    - default.yml
```

If it has just replace the existing content with this. Now you can run `rubocop` as usual.

```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```
